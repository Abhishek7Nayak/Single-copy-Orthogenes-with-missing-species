# Single-copy-Orthogenes-with-missing-species

OrthoFinder detects single copy orthogroups using sequence similarity searches, but to get the single copy orthogroups with missing species, the below strategy can be used:

After executing OrthoFinder, many directories are created. Among which the files in **Orthogroup directory** can be used for the extraction of single copy orthogroups with missing species
**Orthogroups directory** -----> ***Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv***, Orthogroups.tsv, Orthogroups.txt, Orthogroups_SingleCopyOrthologues.txt, Orthogroups_UnassignedGenes.tsv. 
***Orthogroups.GeneCount.tsv*** can be used to extract the orthogroups with missing species
